    <p>
      The myFlix API serves as the server-side component of the myFlix web
      application, providing users with access to information about different
      movies, directors, and genres. With this API, users can retrieve details
      about movies, add and remove movies from their list of favorites, update
      their user information, and much more. Built using Node.js, Express,
      MongoDB, and Mongoose, this RESTful API follows industry best practices
      for authentication, authorization, data validation, and security. Whether
      you're a frontend developer integrating the API into the client-side
      application or a movie enthusiast exploring the vast world of cinema, this
      documentation will guide you through utilizing the myFlix API effectively.
